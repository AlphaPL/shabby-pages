# Shabby Pages 2022
Shabby Pages is a corpus of born-digital document images with both ground truth and distorted versions appropriate for use in training models to reverse distortions and recover to original denoised documents.  This state-of-the-art dataset with synthetically-generated real-world representations can be used to improve document layout detection, text extraction and OCR processes that depend on denoising and binarization preprocessing models.


# About The Augraphy Project
The synthetic distortions in this dataset were generated by The Augraphy Project using a custom Augraphy pipeline to create realistic old and noisy documents from "born digital" sources.  This simulation of realistic paper-oriented process distortions creates large amounts of training data for AI/ML processes to learn how to remove those distortions.

Augraphy is a Python library that creates multiple copies of original documents though an augmentation pipeline that randomly distorts each copy -- degrading the clean version into dirty and realistic copies rendered through synthetic paper printing, faxing, scanning and copy machine processes.
