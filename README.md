Corpus of born-digital document images with both ground truth and distorted versions appropriate for use in training models to reverse distortions and recover to original denoised documents.  This state-of-the-art dataset with synthetically-generated real-world representations can be used to improve document layout detection, text extraction and OCR processes that depend on denoising and binarization preprocessing models.
